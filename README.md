- 👋 Hi, I’m @UY-Dana
👀 I’m interested in ... software development, UI design, artificial intelligence, and IoT. As an electromechanical engineer, I find inspiration in the intersection of these fields and how they can be leveraged to create innovative solutions.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in machine learning and exploring the latest trends in user interface design.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... tech projects that fuse AI and IoT to develop cutting-edge applications. I'm always open to collaborations that push the boundaries of technology and design.
